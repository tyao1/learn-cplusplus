# learning modern c++...
- Using buck for building
- Trying buckaroo package management system... Most packages aren't up to date
- Using boost beast, asio to fetch http content
- Using openssl to hash the bitfinex headers (but still got 400 bad request)
- Tried inheritance in c++
- include header_namespace
- Tried template class for compile time inheritance, but had no idea how to make
it work with shared_from_this
- smart pointers are cool
- c++ is much more powerful than I thought, but too tedious to implement
a http client :(
